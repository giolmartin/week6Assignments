Section Handout #9: Objects and Data Structures

1. Primitive vs. Objects

 public boolean IsNameQ() {
      String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
      return (name == "Q");
}

The problem with the above method is that is trying to assert equality between two different objects.
 The == sign is checking to see if both objects are the same in memory.
In this case it will always return false. 


public boolean IsNameQ() {
String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
char ch = name.charAt(0);
return ((ch == 'Q') && (name.length() == 1));
}

The above code checks if the char at position 0 (first letter) of the String is 'Q', in this case the == is useful because is comparing two elements on the same level.
name.lenght() returns a int number. so if the String name = "Q", it will return true.
